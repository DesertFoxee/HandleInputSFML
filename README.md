## Title :
Extend event handling with SFML / C ++
## Introduction :
I find it difficult to capture the event and handle it with SFML.

- No catch key combinations
- There is no combination of keyboard and mouse
- No doubleclick 

PS: These are just my subjective opinions in the process of capturing and handling events with SFML
## Version :
- V1.0 
## Content:
Include :<br/>
**m_basicinput** _(m_basicinput.h)_: common handling for both keyboard and mouse<br/>
**m_keyboard** _(m_keyboard.h)_: handling for keyboards (frequently used events)
- presskey
- presskeyone
- presscomplexkey

**m_mouse** _(m_mouse.h)_: handling for mouse  (frequently used events)

- click
- doubleclick
- presskeyandpress

## Update : 

## Conclude :
I am not sure it is a good solution. I look forward to contributing to development. Thanks
